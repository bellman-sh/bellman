 * Room operations, and the seam under them.

 * Each operation here does the whole thing: resolve the room, authorize the
 * caller, mutate, append the event, write the audit row. That is the point.
 * `src/server.ts` used to hold the sequence inline in every tool handler, and
 * #49 wants an HTTP API over the same rooms — a second transport re-typing the
 * sequence would be a second chance to skip the audit row or the frozen guard,
 * on exactly the paths where skipping one matters.
 *
 * So a transport's job is narrowed to translation: call an operation, map its
 * result. MCP maps it to a ToolResult, a route maps it to a status code.
 *
 * This module must stay importable by the Node build: no `cloudflare:workers`,
 * directly or transitively.
