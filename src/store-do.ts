/**
 * Durable Objects implementation of BellmanStore.
 *
 * Topology — three classes, each matching a real scope in the data:
 *
 *   SessionDO   one per session. Holds the session record, its events, and the
 *               live long-poll waiters. Every request for a session routes to
 *               the same instance, which is what makes an in-memory waiter list
 *               correct here and what gives read-then-register its atomicity.
 *   RegistryDO  singleton. The join-code index, pending connect tokens, and
 *               per-user monthly create counts — the three lookups that cannot
 *               live inside a session because they are how you FIND one.
 *   AuditDO     one per org, so an org's audit stream is physically its own
 *               object. A cross-org session writes to both, and neither org's
 *               DO is reachable from the other.
 *
 * On sweep(): MemoryStore scans every session on a timer. There is no cheap
 * global iteration across a DO namespace, so session TTL is enforced by a
 * per-object alarm and connect tokens expire lazily on read. sweep() is
 * therefore a no-op — see the comment on the method.
